## The links of white papers, articles, and other resources that touch on the topic of the database links and key takeaways

Last updated: 2024-10-22

The post is updated regularly to include the latest resources and key takeaways and to remove the outdated ones. \
The resources are listed in the order of my personal investigation and interest in the topic.

#### Andy Pavlo â€” The official ten-year retrospective of NewSQL databases (2022)
Resource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwkS82zs65g

Key Takeaways:

- **Selling a new OLTP** distributed database startup **is hard** because it is a product of a high-risk. \
In comparison, the OLAP distributed database startup is a low-risk due to the impact of the running queries on the business 
(e.g. no one loses the revenue if the query is slow).
- 5 key points of the NewSQL databases [1][2] :
  - **Distributed transactions** ACID support for transactions
  - **SQL** (not NoSQL) as a primary interface for the database
  - **Scale-out** (not scale-up)
  - **Consistency** - non-locking concurrency control
  - **Performance** - high per-node performance
- **Shared-nothing architecture** is a key to the NewSQL databases, but it is not a panacea. In the opposite side, the 
shared-disk architecture is also viable for the OLTP databases (e.g. Google Spanner, NeonDB).
- **Middleware solutions** was a big trend in the 2010s, but they were not successful and **were squeezed out** by 
the cloud providers and the NewSQL databases.
- **Automation** of the database management **is a key** to the success of the NewSQL databases, whatever architecture 
they are based on for the next decade.

#### Calvin: fast distributed transactions for partitioned database systems
Resource: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2213836.2213838

Thoughts:

- Move as much work as possible earlier in the transaction to avoid the bottleneck of the sequencer and **out of the
transaction boundaries**.
- **Artificial delays to enforce tx order.** Nondeterministic execution of transactions in a distributed databases can arbitrarily reorder the transactions maximizing
the resource utilization, deterministic execution is a key concept in the Calvin database system, which respects the
**sequencer's order** of the transactions, but introduces **artificial delays** for the scheduler to enforce the order.
- **Slow-storage and network delays handle the same.** Calvin's transaction throughput is unaffected by the presence of transactions that access slow storage nodes or 
that are access remote data partitions via the network. 
- **Predict latencies in order to enforce deterministic execution.** The Calvin system uses the **predictive latency** 
to enforce the deterministic execution of the transactions both for the local and remote transactions. The sequencer
must track which keys are in-memory and which are on-disk on all storage nodes to predict the latencies.

Key Takeaways:

- The sensitivity of the overall system throughput depends on two factors:
  - **The number of machines** in the system as for every multi partition transaction the system adds an overhead of:
  serealizing and deserealizing read requests, context switching between transaction to wait for the responses, setting 
  up, executing and cleaning up the transactions context.
  - **The level of contention**. The higher the contention the more likely each machine's slowdown will affect the overall
  system throughput as it cause the other machines to slow down their transaction processing as well.

**Key Takeaways**

Tablet is a statefull abstraction layer that is responsible for (depending on its type) having a view on a portion 
of the data in distributed storage, balancing the load by slicing, merging, moving tablets between the nodes,
and providing the transactional guarantees in order to serve the **high availability** and **low latency** for the
workloads, responsible for writing a WAL log for durability.

Key features of the tablets:
- **Replication State Machine (RSM)** writing the WAL log to preserve the state, restoring the state from the log, and
providing guarantees like Raft or Paxos.
- **ACID transaction guarantees** and storing the data as the LSM-tree.
- **Providing API** for the layer above to interact with the tablet, e.g. insert, update, delete, etc.
